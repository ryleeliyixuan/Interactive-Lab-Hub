C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)


## Part A. Plan 

### Setting, Players, Actions, and Goals

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

The interactive device I am about to stage is a rave wristband that detects the bpm (beats per minute) in sound and displays different colors of light according to the light spectrum. This wristband is designed for ravers who attend music festivals like Coachella and EZoo.

In a rave, the wristband is the event entry pass. Every raver needs to wear this rave wristband in the setting. Putting hands up in the air and waving them is the most common action when audiences enjoy the music during a rave. This must-have item will engage ravers in the event by providing a visual perception of music. 
As tracks change their tempo throughout the course of the tune, the wristband will display different colors of lights. The higher the BPM, the longer the wavelength of light displayed on the wristband. The relationship between color and wavelength can be found below.

![Light Spectrum](https://github.com/ryleeliyixuan/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%201/lab1-light-spectrum-explained.jpeg)

For instance, a tune may start at 88 BPM, gradually build up to 128 BPM, and go back to 100 BPM during the drop. Accordingly, the wristband will first display a green light. During the build-up, the light will transit from green to yellow and finally turn red as the track reaches the climax. As the beats drop, the light will change from red to yellow. 

### StoryBoard Version 1

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

### Feedback and StoryBoard Version 2

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

I received feedback regarding the representation of sounds with different tempos. The text boxes labeling BPMs were not enough. It would be better if more visualization were added to the pictures. In response to it, I added “lightning” icons to further illustrate sounds with different tempos.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

It's easy to represent different tempos in the storyboard with texts and graphs. However, it may be hard for audiences to detect the change of tempo if the change is not very obvious.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

To solve the above issue, I will choose a track that has an obvious build-up before the drop. Moreover, I noticed that the change of tempo was a continuous process. So it would be better if we gradually change the light from green to red along the light spectrum instead of suddenly changing it from one color to another. 


## Part C. Prototype the device


### Feedback on Tinkerbelle

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

I used Mac OS and installed Python 3.8.8. I failed to run [Tinkerbelle](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle) on my mac as port 5000 isn't listening to the page. I tried to configure my mac using the methods mentioned on Slack but also failed.


## Part D. Wizard the device
**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

I realized that colors should change continuously so I adopted this [color picker](http://color.aurlien.net/) on Mac instead.

## Part E. Costume the device

### Develop the Device

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

### Concerns or Opportunities that Influence the Way I've Designed the Device

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

* The wristband is a one-size item. The strong elastic trap will allow users to adjust it for different sizes of arms. 
* During the rave, people need to wave their hands. The release buckle ensures that users can wear the wristband without worrying about shaking it off.


## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
